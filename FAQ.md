## FAQ for all Board Members

### As a Board Member, do I need to know about SBOMs?
No. However, all Board Members should feel comfortable that the appropriate Board roles 
and Executive Team members know the corporate SBOM strategy, 
the strategic opportunties it offers (if any),

The opportunities and risks differ for public/private, profit/non-profile, your industry, and your company specifics. See the FAQs in the following subsections for more detail.
